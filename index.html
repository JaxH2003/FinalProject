    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <article class="blog1">
      <p> I am currently a Junior at Michigan State University studying Information Science with a Minor in Business. Currently, i'm aiming to apply my academic background in this field to pursue an internship for the Summer of 2024. Though I don't know exactly what I want to do for a career yet, I have interests in Cybersecurity and Data and am hopeful to find a place where I can put my skills to use. </p>
      <p> Outside of school I like to play videogames, I also enjoy hanging out with friends and watching or participating in sports. I been working since the age of 15 and I have job experience in many fields such as restaurants, retail, and landscape work. I also am a big fan of the Detroit Lions and have been a super fan since as long as I can remember, so the weekly Lions game really effects my mood for the week. Overall, Im a very hardworking, independant person with an outgoing personality who is eager to learn new skills and hopes to add value to any organization that I have to chance to be a part of.</p>

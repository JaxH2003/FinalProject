    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
    <article class="edu">
    <p>I grew up in Milford, Michigan and attended Milford High School where I got my high school diploma. From there I decided to move 40 minutes west to Michigan State University where I am Studying Information Science with a Minor in Business. Throughout college so far i've managed a 3.7 GPA and am on track to graduate Spring 2025. My goal is to get an internship for the Summer of 2024 to support my future resume and search for a career. I am currently working on certifications in Microsoft Office and Cybersecurity through online sources to help support my resume and future job searching.</p>
    <p>While in school, i've joined clubs such as the MSU Ski Club and the MSU Wake team. I also like to attend the schools sporting events, specifically football and basketball.</p>

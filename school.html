    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Milford Michigan and attended Milford High School where I got my high school diploma. From there I decided to move 40 minutes west to Michigan State University where I am Studying Information Science with a minor in Business. Throughout college so far i've managed a 3.7 GPA and am on track to graduate spring 2025. My goal is to get an internship for the summer of 2024 to support my future resume and search for a career. </p>
